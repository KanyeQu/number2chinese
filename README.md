# number2chinese
Convert number to Chinese (1234 -> 一千两百三十四)

``` python
>>> number_intepreter(1024)
一千零二十四
>>> number_intepreter(100000000)
一亿
>>> number_intepreter(100001234)
一亿零一千二百三十四
```



give any number from -999999999999 to 999999999999, it will returns an intepretation with Chinese syntax. Any number out of that range, I don't even know how to say that in Chinese, so I didn't go that far. You can also change the result language to Cantonese or other version of Chinese(壹 贰) by changing the constant on top of file.

feel free to grab and use it in your project ;)
